<h1>Test Application</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>You are required to create a small command-line utility to help a fictional company determine the dates they need to pay salaries to their sales department. This company is handling their sales payroll in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales staff get a regular monthly fixed base salary and a monthly bonus.</li>
<li>The base salaries are paid on the last day of the month unless that day is a Saturday or a Sunday (weekend) in which case they are paid on the friday before.</li>
<li>On the 15th of every month bonuses are paid for the previous month, unless that day is a weekend. In that case, they are paid the first Wednesday after the 15th.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the utility should be a CSV file, containing the payment dates for the remainder of this year. The CSV file should contain a column for the month name, a column that contains the salary payment date for that month, and a column that contains the bonus payment date.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>In order to get the code running the machine will require working copies of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Zend Framework</li>
    <li>PHPUnit</li>
    <li>PHP >5.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The path to Zend Framework may need to be set up in the file <strong>setup.php</strong> in the root directory of this project. Please add the framework's parent path to the include path list. This should be the only change required.</p>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

<p>In order to run the code visit the <strong>src</strong> directory and call:<br/>
<pre>
php payments.php &lt;file_name&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>I have set up the payment configuration in the <strong>src/configs/payments.ini</strong> file. This will allow you to set up additional payment types and modify the payment types as set out in the test.</p>
<p>Below is an explanation of the parameters each config required:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
    <th>Paramter</th>
    <th>Values</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
    <th>[Payment_Name]</th>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Payment name</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
    <th>payday</th>
    <td>start|end|1-31</td>
    <td>Day of month upon which payment should be attempted</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
    <th>weekend.allow</th>
    <td>true|false</td>
    <td>Whether payments can be made on weekends</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
    <th>weekend.move</th>
    <td>before|after</td>
    <td>If weekend clash found does the payment come before or after the clash)
weekend.day = monday-friday (on which day the payment should then be made</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
    <th>payshift</th>
    <td>integer</td>
    <td>Whether to shift the pay or not, e.g. in the case of bonus' these are paid the month after, could be the month before with -1)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>Tests can be found in the <strong>tests</strong> sub-directory, simply calling phpunit from that location will invoke the testsuite. Coverage reports and testdox can then be found in the <strong>logs</strong> subdirectory.</p>
